# Backbone boilerplate sample app

A simple application to demonstrate backbone boilerplate by consuming the google tasks API.


To run:

1. Clone the repo and put it in a web server document root or virtual host.
2. Set up an entry in the hosts file like the following (where n.n.n.n is the server IP):
    n.n.n.n   bbb-sample.lognllc.com

    If not then the google tasks API will not allow the connection.

3. Modify the task list id to one that you own (or implement selecting it in the UI!)
4. Authorize through the Google OAuth popup.
